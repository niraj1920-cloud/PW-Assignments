This means that our model hasn’t captured patterns in the training data and hence cannot perform well on the testing data too. If this is the case, our model cannot perform on new data and cannot be sent into production. \n",

    "##### What is Variance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance is the very opposite of Bias. During training, it allows our model to ‘see’ the data a certain number of times to find patterns in it. If it does not work on the data for long enough, it will not find patterns and bias occurs. On the other hand, if our model is allowed to view the data too many times, it will learn very well for only that data. It will capture most patterns in the data,  but it will also learn from the unnecessary data present, or from the noise.\n",

    "##### Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
    "For any model, we have to find the perfect balance between Bias and Variance. This just ensures that we capture the essential patterns in our model while ignoring the noise present it in. This is called Bias-Variance Tradeoff. It helps optimize the error in our model and keeps it as low as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "An optimized model will be sensitive to the patterns in our data, but at the same time will be able to generalize to new data. In this, both the bias and variance should be low so as to prevent overfitting and underfitting."

    "Detecting overfitting and underfitting in machine learning models is crucial for ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen data. Here are some common methods for detecting both:\n",
    "\n",
    "Training and Validation Curves: Plotting the training and validation performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, loss) as functions of training iterations or epochs. If the training performance continues to improve while the validation performance starts to degrade, it indicates overfitting. Conversely, if both training and validation performance are poor, it suggests underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning Curves: Similar to training and validation curves, learning curves display the model's performance on both training and validation sets as functions of the training set size. If there's a large gap between the training and validation curves with increasing training set size, it may indicate overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Validation: Using techniques like k-fold cross-validation, where the dataset is divided into k subsets, and the model is trained k times, each time using a different subset as the validation set. Large discrepancies in performance across folds may indicate overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Complexity vs. Performance: Varying the complexity of the model (e.g., changing the number of parameters, adjusting the depth of a decision tree) and observing how performance changes. Overfitting tends to occur when the model is overly complex relative to the available data, while underfitting occurs when the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization Techniques: Applying regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization, dropout, or early stopping. These techniques penalize overly complex models, helping to mitigate overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation Set Performance: Monitoring the model's performance on a separate validation set that was not used during training. If the validation performance is significantly worse than the training performance, it could indicate overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test Set Performance: Finally, evaluating the model's performance on a completely independent test set. If the performance on the test set is substantially lower than on the training or validation sets, it suggests overfitting."
